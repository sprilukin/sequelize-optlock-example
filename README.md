# sequelize-optlock-example

An example of implementing optimistic locking technique in sequelize framework.
Had to modify sequelize framework by itself to achieve this goal 
(look at the fork: https://github.com/sprilukin/sequelize for changes)

See issue https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/1028
where optimistic locking implementation in sequelize framework is discussed
